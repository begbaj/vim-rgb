vim-rgb is a plugin that enables realtime updataes of the keyboard leds layout, so when you switch from,
say, normal mode to insert mode, the keyboards leds layout changes as defined on the theme. Thus, OpenRGB.

vim-rgb will only:
1 - recognize the "vim mode"
2 - change the leds layout as the "vim mode" changes, according to the theme selected.
